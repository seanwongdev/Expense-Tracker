This is a JavaScript mini project done without any frameworks to practice concepts learnt.

**From Before:**
- Reinforcing MVC model from scratch
- Making use of publisher-subscriber pattern between controller and views
- Use of advanced DOM, with some event propagation and delegation
- Localstorage to save the data between page reloads

**Newer Concepts**
- Use of parent class and extension to child class
- .reduce method and use of it in a sum usecase
- DateTime formatting
- Errors rendering + alert(messages)


**Getting Started**

since you need parcel for this.. just run in your terminal
1. "npm parcel install -D"  
2. "npm run start"  

Open http://localhost:1234 with your browser to see the result.
